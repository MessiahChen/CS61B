Gitlet Design Document
----------------------


Classes and Data Structures
---------------------------
**** Commit ****
1. LinkedList<Commit> _parent: The parents of a commit.
2. HashSet<String> _trackedFiles: The tracked files of the commit.
3. HashMap<String, String> _fileWithBlob: A map mapping file name to blob name.

**** Gitlet ****
1. String _currentBranch: Current branch.
2. Commit _head: Current head.
3. HashMap<String, LinkedList<Commit>> _branchCommits: A map mapping branch name with a list of the commits in it.
4. LinkedHashMap<String, Commit> _allCommits: A linked hashmap mapping commit id with commit instance in sequence.
5. HashSet<String> _remove: Files to be removed.
6. HashSet<String> _staging: A record of staging file names.

**** Main ****
Entrance of the program, takes in the commands and switch among them.

Algorithms
----------
**** Commit ****
1. Commit(): There are three constructors. One for initial commit, one for creating child commit and one for merge
commit.
2. getHash(): Calculate the SHA-1 code of the commit.

**** Gitlet ****
1. serialize(): Serialize Gitlet insatnce into sequence file to store.
2. deserialize(): Deserialize sequence file into Gitlet insatnce.
3. log(): Show the log of the current branch, tracing back from _head.
4. globalLog(): Show the log of all the commits, using _allCommits.
5. content(): Return the merge conflict string, using Utils.writeContents() to write to file afterwards.

Persistence
-----------
1. Every time init is called, a new directory .gitlet/ will be created (if not already existed), and most persistence is
done there.
2. There's a .gitlet/staging/ directory stores the temporary staging files.
3. There's a .gitlet/staging/ directory stores the blob files.
4. Serialization is used on the Gitlet instance. Every time after one line of command is called the Gitlet instance
will be serialized into .gitlet/gitlet.ser. When next line of command occurs, the gitlet.ser will be deserialized
into Gitlet instance. In this way, the branch and commit information in Gitlet class will not lost.
